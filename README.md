# 🌟 Dream Big — A Game Jam Project

**Dream Big** is a reimagined version of the classic Google Chrome T-Rex game—with a twist of inspiration and empowerment.

Instead of a dinosaur, you play as **Lily**, a girl chasing her dreams and dodging “fear clouds.” The goal? **Collect 3 dreams** while avoiding fear—and don't stop running.
