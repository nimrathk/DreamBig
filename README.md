# Game Jam Code - Dream Big

In this project, I made my own version of Google’s Dinosaur Game (T-Rex run!) with a new twist – controlling the dinosaur (a girl named Lily in my game) with a spacebar to jump over the cacti (“fear clouds”) and collect 3 dreams along the way.

The user wins after collecting all 3 dreams, and loses if fails to collect all the dreams or crashes into a "fear cloud."

Utilizing p5.js and the p5play JavaScript library, this game simulates real-life physics in a virtual game environment. I also use object-oriented programming in script.js to create objects that represent Lily, the clouds, and the dreams which each have their own classes.
