# Game Jam Code - Dream Big

In this project, I attempted to make my own version of Google’s Dinosaur Game (T-Rex run!) with a unique twist – controlling the dinosaur (a girl named Lily, in this case) with a spacebar to make Lily jump over “fear clouds” and collect 3 dreams.

Utilizing p5.js and the p5play JavaScript library, this game uses object-oriented programming in script.js to create objects that represent Lily, the clouds, and the dreams.
