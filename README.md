# Game Jam Code - Dream Big

The song “Am I Dreaming” from the soundtrack of "Spiderman: Across the Spider-Verse" got me thinking more about dreams and how they can make you feel hopeful for the future. 

The Chrome Dino Game inspired the mechanics and challenge of the game:
The player clicks the spacebar to make the character, Lily, jump over “fear clouds” and collect all 3 dreams in the game.
